The children loved spending time in this little garden as it gave them a sense of peace and calm amidst all the noise and chaos that surrounded them. One day, while playing with each other, John happened to pick up a little flower from the ground. \n\nJohn was always taught to respect nature by his parents and never to disturb anything in the garden. He knew this because he had heard his mother say it a million times before. But somehow, the urge to play with the flower overpowered him as he tucked it behind one of his ears. \n\nSarah noticed what John was doing and immediately said, \"Hey! Leave that flower alone!\" but instead of listening to her, John continued playing around with the flower until he heard footsteps approaching them from afar. He quickly put down the flower in fear that he would get caught by his parents. \n\nSarah was upset and angry at him for not listening to her. She told him off while they were both on their way home, \"Why did you do it? What happened to your values?\" John looked at her with a guilty look on his face as he responded, \"I know I shouldn't have done that but I can't help it.\" \n\nThat night, Sarah and John sat down together on the couch and had a heart-to-heart conversation about what happened earlier in the day. Sarah told him how important respecting nature was to her as well as how much she hated the fact that he did not follow his own values. She explained to John that all living beings deserve respect and dignity regardless of their species.\n\nJohn listened quietly, but his mind started racing with thoughts about what he had done wrong. He felt guilty for not listening to her like he usually does when she talks. After a while, they both fell asleep on the couch together without realizing it was bedtime already. \n\nThe next day, John apologized to Sarah and asked her if there was anything that he could do to make things right between them again. He promised her that he would never pick up any flower from the garden again even if she wasn't watching him. Sarah accepted his apology without saying a word as they continued their playtime together in the garden.\n\nThat night, John couldn't sleep well because of all the thoughts that were going through his head about what he had done wrong and how he could do better next time.
